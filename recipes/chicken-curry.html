    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Quick Mild Chicken Curry - a delicately flavoured curry using chicken and yoghurt for a perfect family meal any night of the week.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>400g of boneless skinless chicken breast (uncooked) - sliced into chunks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of mild curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of tomato paste</li>
        <li>360ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>100g fat-free​ greek-style yoghurt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of coconut extract (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of corn starch</li>
        <li>fresh coriander</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spray a pan over a medium heat with some spray oil.</li>
        <li>Fry the ginger, garlic and onion until softened, add a bit of the stock if they start to stick to pan. Tip in the chicken and cook until lightly browned, about 5 mins, then add in the curry powder and cook for 1 min further.</li>
        <li>Pour over the stock and tomato paste and simmer for about 20 mins until the chicken is cooked through. Make sure it is bubbling so that the liquid reduces down.</li>
        <li>Add the yoghurt and coconut extract to a jug and stir in a couple of spoonfuls of the liquid from the curry.</li>
        <li>Add the cornstarch to a small bowl and mix to a paste with a little water</li>
        <li>Add both the yoghurt and cornstarch mix to the curry and stir over low heat until sauce is smooth and thickened.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with some fresh coriander and serve with your choice of sides.</li>
    </ol>



    </ul>
